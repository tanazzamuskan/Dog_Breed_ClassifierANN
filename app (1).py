    <h2 style='color:#FF8C00;'>Problem Statement</h2>

    <div style="font-size:17px; line-height:1.8; color:#000000; text-align:justify;">
        Dogs are one of the earliest domesticated animals and exist with a diversity of physical and behavioural traits. Thus, we are building a robust image-based dog-breed classification system that identifies a dog's breed from a photo and returns breed-specific care information (size, lifespan, grooming, exercise, common health issues, diet tips). The system must be accurate across breeds, handle real-world photo noise (occlusion, varied lighting, poses), and integrate into a simple UI for users to upload images and receive classification plus actionable care guidance.
    </div>

    <br>

    <h2 style='color:#FF8C00;'>Proposed Solution</h2>

    <div style="font-size:17px; line-height:1.8; color:#000000;">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary goal:</strong> Accurately classify dog images into breed classes using a Vision Transformer backbone fine-tuned on the dataset.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary goal:</strong> Given a predicted breed, return a curated breed-specific care profile (textual and well-structured), such as delivering a structured care profile covering size, lifespan, grooming, exercise needs, common health issues, and diet guidance.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 style='color:#FF8C00;'>Dataset Overview</h2>

    <div style="font-size:17px; line-height:1.7; color:#000000;">
        We used the <strong>Kaggle Dog Breed Identification</strong> dataset, containing:
        <ul>
            <li>~20,580 labeled dog images across <strong>120 breeds</strong></li>
            <li>Each image contains a single dog with variations in lighting, background, and pose</li>
            <li>Labels provided as CSV mapping <strong>image IDs → breed names</strong></li>
            <li>High intra-class similarity and high inter-class variance</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
